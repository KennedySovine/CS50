# TWITCH SPEAK
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description:

This chrome extention turns all webpages into Twitch speak. This integrates words such as pog, VOD, sagde, and emotes.

Originally, the chrome extention had been planned to be a hydrate reminder type of extention, where everytime you hydrate, a dog is happy.
Unforutnately, Chrome is mean and does not allow what I planned to actually happen unless I used a complicated storage sync thing that they require.

To use this extention, you have to go to chrome://extentions, turn on developer mode, and then unlaod the package.

Manifest.json identifies the extention and allows for the extention to alter the page.
Popup.js is the scirpt that replaces the words on the webpage to include plurals and capitals.
